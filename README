Linux kernel - Multiplexed virtual TTYs using Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing
===============================================================================
Fork of Linux with a a module that can instantiate multiple virtual TTYs
that get multiplexed over a single (probably physical) TTY using COBS.
This can be useful if you want a console, printk output, and kgdb connection
but only have one TTY, like is the case when using xHCI DbC for kernel
development and debugging.

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
